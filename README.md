# Rentum-Movie-Rental-project
Back-end code for a Movie Rental System using REST APIs

It is developed using the Express framework. For the database, I have used MongoDB.
It also has authorization and authentication services in it.

To use this application:-

1. You have to clone this repo into your system.
2. Using npm install you have to install all the dependencies.
3. Then you to set up a MongoDB database service either using locally on your machine or using any online service.
4. Set all the environment variables for the database service.
5. Setup a personal key for the jwt token so that you can easily verify if the user is authorized or not.
6. Start the server using the terminal command "node index.js".
7. Use postman to access the routes.
